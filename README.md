Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

    Software engineering is a branch of science that applies engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality softwares. Software engineering as a plays a very important role in today's world. It aids the creation of softwares and applications that can solve real problems that people may have in different areas e.g. healthcare, entertainment, academic, financial and business sectors.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

    Some key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include:
    1. The development of programming languages like C++, Fortran, Javascript, etc.
    2. The shift to agile methodology in the early 2000's from the traditional methods that were prone to failure.
    3. The advent of object-oriented-programming.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

    The phases of the Software Development Life Cycle are:
    1. Requirements- This is the first stage and it entails researching and documenting the specifications of a software. It helps to make sure that the software meets the customers's needs. 
    2. Design- This phase involves the planning of the software's structure, components and user interface.
    3. Implementation- At this point, the software engineer begins to write codes in order to build the software or application according to the specifications and requirements in step 1.
    4. Testing- Testing involves finding and fixing bugs to make sure the software continues to meet quality standards and satisfaction of the users.
    5. Deployment- This is when the software is released to consumers for use.
    6. Maintenance- This involves fixing any issues after the software has been released.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
